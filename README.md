The `femto` framework aims to offer not only a compact and comprehensive toolkit for predicting binding free energies
using methods including `ATM` and `SepTop`, but also a full suite of utilities for running advanced simulations using
OpenMM, including support for HREMD and REST2.

_**Warning:** The ATM implementation was recently updated to make use of the new `ATMForce` shipped with OpenMM 8.1.
While every effort was made to ensure correctness, this was a major change that is still being tested and there may
be bugs. Please report any issues you encounter._

_Further, the default protocols selected for the ATM and SepTop methods are still being tested and optimized, and may
not be optimal. It is recommended that you run a few test calculations to ensure that the results are reasonable._

## Installation

This package can be installed using `conda` (or `mamba`, a faster version of `conda`):

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge femto
```

If you are running with MPI on an HPC cluster, you may need to instruct conda to use your local installation
depending on your setup

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge femto "openmpi=4.1.5=*external*"
```

where in this example you should change `4.1.5` to match the version of OpenMPI installed on your cluster / machine.

## Getting Started

To get started, see the [usage guide](https://psivant.github.io/femto/latest/guide-md).

## Acknowledgements

This framework benefited hugely from the work of Psivant's [Open Science Fellows](https://psivant.com/company/open-science-fellows/).

### ATM

The ATM implementation is based upon the work and advice of E. Gallicchio _et al_:

### SepTop

The SepTop implementation is based upon the work and advice of H. M. Baumann, D. L. Mobley _et al_:
